One of the current and developing assemblies for Gulp. With support for current versions Gulp 4 and Webpack 5. The main idea of the assembly is to simplify and speed up the layout process. For this, a flow was implemented:

1. Full generation of all parameters and font files.

2. The assemblies use the architecture of components and for them scripts were released for quickly creating, connecting to certain paths in the architecture and deleting a component.

3. Optimization of assembly processing, the main load and data processing falls on the project build. Thanks to this, the start of the project is carried out an order of magnitude quickly.

4. Simplified architecture of the assembly itself ... . Thanks to which you yourself can supplement or customize the assembly according to your requirements. Scheme and description of the architecture and parts of the code ->

- Below you can see the details that were described above. -->
